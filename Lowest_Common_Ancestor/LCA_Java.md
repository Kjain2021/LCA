The first commit that is LCA.java empty file being created by the other user Khushboojain236 is my other personal account. I only realised later I hadn't changed accounts before committing to this git account.

It is a basic implementation of finding the Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Search Tree. It takes input from the user in the form:
Firstly, the number of nodes, followed by the values of the node.Then finally asking for the two nodes we wish to figure out the lowest common ancestor. 
There are a few assumptions on which the implementation is based:
1. Each node is unique. 
2. The nodes for which we are searching the LCA, are unique and exist in the tree.
